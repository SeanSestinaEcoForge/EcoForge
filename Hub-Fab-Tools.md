# Engineering Production Hub – Fab Tools & Replication (EcoForge)

This file details the fab tools integrated into the 40×60 ft workshop hub. These enable in-house production of custom parts for the next container/node or homestead build — closing the loop on self-replication.

## Key Fab Tools (2026 Pricing & Purpose)
| Tool                               | Model/Example Recommendation                                 | Cost Range (Installed) | How It Builds the Next Node/Homestead |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| CNC Plasma Cutter                  | Langmuir CrossFire Pro or Hypertherm Powermax (4x8 ft table)       | $4,000 – $15,000      | Cuts metal sheets/frames/brackets/door mods/racking for new containers. Precise, fast metal fab in-house. |
| Large-Format 3D Printer            | Anycubic Kobra 3 Max (420×420×500mm) or Bambu Lab P2S/X1C upgrades | $600 – $5,000         | Prints custom fittings (vermi bay trays, sensor housings, RO adapters, Optimus tool holders, jigs/fixtures). Multi-material capable. |
| Supporting Fab Tools               | MIG/TIG welder, drill press, bench grinder, filament dryer/enclosure | $2,000 – $5,000       | Weld CNC-cut pieces, assemble printed parts, maintain printers. |
| Pyrolysis Unit                     | Small on-site biochar kiln (wood waste → biochar)                  | $5,000 – $10,000      | Self-supplies 35% biochar media for vermi beds in new nodes. Closes carbon loop. |
| **Hub Fab Subtotal**               | Full in-house replication capability                                | **$10,000 – $30,000** | Enables 70–80% custom parts for next builds without external vendors. |

## Replication Workflow
1. Design new part (CAD in repo or Grok prompt).  
2. CNC cuts metal components (frames, supports).  
3. 3D print plastic/fittings (adapters, mounts).  
4. Weld/assemble → install in new container/homestead.  
5. Test with live /simulate endpoint → commit metrics to repo.  

This setup turns the hub into a self-replicating engine: build one node → use it to fabricate parts for the next → scale to kits for others. All tools open-source friendly (e.g., BigFDM-style large printers if upgraded).
