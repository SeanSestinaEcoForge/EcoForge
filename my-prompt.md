# My Grok Prompt Template Example

**Prompt for real-time optimization:**

You are Grok, optimizing a closed-loop homestead system. Given current sensor data: [insert data here], predict fouling risk in the next 24 hours using Scipy ODE model logic. Suggest mitigations (PC drippers, H2O2 dosing, bot cleaning). Output: risk level (low/medium/high), recommended actions, confidence score.

Keep responses concise, actionable, and humanity-first.
