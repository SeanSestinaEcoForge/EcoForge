## Power Scaling Patch v1: Turbine Gang Integration

**Purpose**  
Add resilient, scalable micro gas turbines (MGTs) for peak loads, outages, and grid independence, inspired by xAI's aggregated "gang" approach for rapid deployment and redundancy.

**Inputs**  
- Site data (location, zoning, fuel availability)  
- Existing systems (solar 10–15 kW, geothermal 5-ton)  
- Fuel source (propane/LP, biodiesel from homestead waste)

**Outputs**  
- 10–20 kW turbine gang capacity  
- Combined Heat & Power (CHP) exhaust heat recovery for water/growing room  
- ROI and efficiency calculations  
- Mobile/on-site deployment strategy

**Earth Benefit**  
- Off-grid reliability in rural OH (bypass permitting delays)  
- Fuel-flex from homestead biodiesel (closed-loop with Waste Module)  
- CHP boosts total efficiency to 75–80%, reducing fuel waste

**Mars Relevance**  
- Methane/CO₂ reformer adaptable for ISRU  
- Gang modularity ideal for Starship-delivered clusters  
- Practice for 300 MW+ colony power scaling

**Key Specs (Cambridge, OH context)**  
- Units: 1–4 × 5–10 kW MGTs (e.g., Capstone-style or biodiesel-modified)  
- Margins: +30–40% for cooling/networking/hiccups  
- Fuel use: ~3–4 gal LP/hour at full 10 kW load  
- Cost estimate: $10k–$25k per 10 kW unit + $5k–$10k integration  
- ROI: 5–8 years (faster with CHP savings + incentives)

**Integration Workflow**  
1. Assess site & permits (keep <50 kW for minimal red tape)  
2. Design hybrid hub in utilities closet (auto-transfer switches)  
3. Install (use Tools Module for vibration mounts, heat exchanger clamps)  
4. Optimize (Simulation Module ODEs for draw/overheads)  
5. Monitor & automate (Automation Module for failover/startup)

**Dependencies**  
- Energy Module (core power hub)  
- Tools Module (mounts, brackets, connectors)  
- Simulation Module (power-overhead ODEs)  
- Waste & Recycling Module (biodiesel production)

**Next Steps**  
- Prototype single 5–10 kW unit mount & test  
- Simulate full gang in Cambridge summer peak conditions  
- Document biodiesel conversion recipe
