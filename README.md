# EcoForge – Open-Source Closed-Loop AI Homesteads

![EcoForge Earth-Mars Hero](images/ecoforge-earth-mars-hero.png)  
**Grok-optimized regenerative systems for Earth abundance & Mars readiness.**  
Vermiponics + biogas spine + RO + Grok reasoning/voice agents (**Ara** default) + Optimus hooks. Family-scale nodes scaling to multi-node networks.

## Visual Overview
## ⚠️ IMPORTANT SAFETY & LIABILITY DISCLAIMER

**EcoForge designs, simulations, blueprints, code, BOMs, and all materials are provided "AS IS" and "WITH ALL FAULTS" for experimental, educational, and open-source research purposes only.**

Building or operating any EcoForge system (vermiponics, biogas digester, RO unit, solar/Powerwall integration, shipping container mods, sensors, etc.) involves **serious risks** including but not limited to:
- Fire or explosion (biogas/methane)
- Electrical shock or arc flash
- Chemical exposure or burns
- Biological hazards (pathogens, ammonia)
- Structural failure
- Flooding or system leaks
- Injury or property damage

**You assume 100% of the risk.**  
We make **no warranties** whatsoever (express or implied) about safety, performance, accuracy of simulations, or fitness for any purpose. Real-world results may differ from sims.

Always:
- Consult licensed engineers, electricians, plumbers, and local authorities
- Comply with all building, environmental, electrical, and safety codes
- Get proper permits and inspections
- Start small and test safely

**Neither Sean Sestina, EcoForge, contributors, nor any affiliates shall be liable** for any damages, injuries, losses, claims, or liabilities arising from the use of this material.

Prototype and build **at your own risk only**. Not for commercial replication without independent professional review and certification.

**Current Status (March 2026)**  
- Blueprint v3 "Supernova" locked: 95–96.5% resource recovery, NH₃ <6 ppm, RO 0.55 kWh/m³, 18.8 LMH flux.  
- API: FastAPI /simulate endpoint (vermiponic + RO ODEs) – live but throttled.  
- Grok Integration: In progress – API key ready, testing reasoning for sim tuning + realtime voice agents (**Ara** voice locked for warm, conversational agents). Awaiting credits top-up for heavy usage.
- [Grok-Ara-Integration-Plan.md](/docs/Grok-Ara-Integration-Plan.md)
- Physical Build: Container 1 prototype queued (Cambridge I-70/I-77 node) – awaiting site confirmation from Dad/Danny.  
- Team: Core push with Danny (build experience), Bridget (reviewing repo/sims), Sean leading. Open for aligned contributors!  
- Treasury: Activation pending (X Money/multisig) – $0 current.  

**Vision**  
True closed-loop abundance: Waste-to-food-to-energy cycles powering homesteads. Grok agents (**Ara** voice) guide ops, explain sims, optimize in realtime. Dual-use Earth/Mars (Starship scalable).  
Full details: [Complete v1.1 Master Protocol List](complete-v1.1-master-protocol-list.md)

**Key Metrics (v3 Supernova – Targets Achieved in Sims)**  
- Vermiponics: 95–96.5% recovery, NH₃ <6 ppm  
- RO: 4.5–5.8 ppm permeate, 0.55 kWh/m³  
- Pilot Scale: 10-person node → 400+ lbs/month surplus food, 30–90 min daily ops  
Live dashboard/sensor feeds: In dev (ESP32 → Grok → Ara alerts with full pH/energy closed-loop monitoring)

**Quick Start**  
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/SeanSestinaEcoForge/SeanSestinaEcoForge`  
2. Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run sim: `python simulations/sim-aquaponics-nutrient-cycle.py`  
4. API: `uvicorn api.main:app --reload` (throttled)  
5. Grok/Voice: Key at console.x.ai. Test **Ara** TTS in playground (x.ai/api/voice):  
   Sample prompt: "Fam, let's optimize this vermiponic cycle step by step."

**Roadmap & Phases**  
- **Phase 1**: Blueprint lock + sim validation → **Complete**  
- **Phase 2**: Container 1 physical build + first cycle → **Next** (queued for site/Danny/Dad greenlight)  
- **Phase 3**: Grok agents live (reasoning + Ara realtime voice), multi-node scaling → Queued  
- **Phase 4**: Treasury activation, community nodes, Optimus integration
