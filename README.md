# EcoForge Core
Open-source framework for AI-driven homesteads: Simulate → Automate → Deploy → Scale for Earth abundance and Mars readiness.

## Mission
Family-first systems blending Grok simulations, Optimus automation, and sustainable designs. Start small (homesteads), scale big (communities, off-world).

## Core Loop
Simulate (predict) → Automate (flow) → Deploy (expand) → Scale → Feedback.

## Modules
1. Design (Blueprint): Layouts, racks, safety.
2. Simulation (Predict): ODEs, models, plots.
3. Energy (Power): Solar, geothermal, turbines.
4. Production (Grow): Crops, yields, processing.
5. Tools (Make): Fabrication, repairs.
6. Automation (Flow): Optimus tasks, workflows.
7. Waste & Recycling (Cycle): Closed loops.
8. Scaling & Deployment (Expand): From prototype to Mars.

## Power Scaling Patch v1 (xAI-Inspired)
- Turbines: Micro gas gangs (5–10 kW units, propane/biodiesel, CHP for 75% eff).
- Margins: +30–40% for cooling/hiccups.
- Integration: Hybrid with solar/geothermal; mobile for permits.
- Details in /patches/power-scaling-v1.md.

## Standards
- Naming: module-artifact-vX (e.g., energy-turbine-gang-v1.md)
- Artifacts: Purpose, Inputs/Outputs, Earth/Mars notes.

## Roadmap
- Short: Prototype turbine mount.
- Medium: Community co-op tests.
- Long: Mars regolith sims.
