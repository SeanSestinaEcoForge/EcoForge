# EcoForge

**Open-source, Grok-powered closed-loop homesteads**  
Earth abundance today, Mars bases tomorrow.  
$9–12k 20ft container prototype • 95%+ recycle • perchlorate-hardened bio-consortia • Optimus mounts • Starship-fit scaling.

Grok as nervous system → real-time monitoring, predictive what-ifs, adaptive coaching.  
Fork → simulate → build → iterate → swarm.
