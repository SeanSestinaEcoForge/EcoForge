# EcoForge – Closed-Loop Abundance for Earth & Mars 🌱🚀

Open-source blueprints, simulations, and protocols to build AI-powered, zero-waste homesteads.  
Grok as nervous system + Optimus dexterity + Starship scale = abundance today, Mars readiness tomorrow.

### Core Vision
Fund the flywheel.

**Earth prototypes** fund the flywheel  
- $9–12k/container BOM  
- 95%+ water recycle  
- <3–5 yr payback  
- Tilapia → greens → perchlorate-tolerant biofilter → biogas → power  

**Mars hardening**  
- Dust-resistant drippers  
- Rad geometry  
- Low-G fluids  
- Cold-adapted kinetics
