## Simulations

Models for closed-loop homestead dynamics.

### Aquaponics + Vermiponics
- **Enhanced model** (temperature, DO, vermicomposting solids):  
  [simulations/aquaponics-vermiponics-enhanced.py](simulations/aquaponics-vermiponics-enhanced.py)  
  Features: Q₁₀ temp scaling, dissolved oxygen with crash thresholds, worm-mediated solids breakdown.

- **Basic nutrient cycle** (earlier version):  
  [sim-aquaponics-nutrient-cycle.py](simulations/sim-aquaponics-nutrient-cycle.py)

Run example:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python simulations/aquaponics-vermiponics-enhanced.py

- **Aquaponics + Vermiponics**  
  File: [simulations/aquaponics-vermiponics-enhanced.py](simulations/aquaponics-vermiponics-enhanced.py)  
  Features: temperature scaling (Q₁₀), dissolved oxygen with crash thresholds, organic solids + worm breakdown  
  Run:  
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python simulations/aquaponics-vermiponics-enhanced.py
