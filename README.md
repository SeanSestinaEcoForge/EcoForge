# EcoForge 🌱⚒️🪐
**Grok-native closed-loop regenerative homesteads** for Earth abundance + Mars readiness.

95–98% nutrient/water/energy recycle  
50–100+ real chaos sensor streams (pH, DO, NH₃, IMU, vision) feeding Grok for embodied AI  
Antifragile 7-loop cascade with stress-triggered bypasses

Current status: Digital/sim phase – full blueprint audited March 13 2026  
Next: Pellet baselines → 90-day Mars runs → Homestead 0.1 prototype

# EcoForge – AI-Powered Regenerative Homesteads ⚒️🌱🪐♾️

Open-source framework for closed-loop, sensor-grounded abundance systems.  
Grok-native by design: real-world chaos data (nutrient kinetics, DO crashes, microbial loops) to train embodied AI better than clean simulations.  
Dual mission: Sovereign Earth homesteads + high-fidelity Mars habitat analogs.

## Vision
95–98% closed-loop recycle (nutrients/water/energy).  
50–100+ sensor streams → ingest endpoints → Grok/Optimus training.  
Earth abundance today → Mars readiness tomorrow.

## Current Status (March 2026)
- 153 commits  
- Live simulations: ODE-based aquaponics/vermiponics (pH/DO/NH₃/alkalinity, Q10 temp, crash recovery)  
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks with sliders & parameter sweeps  
- Grok decision stubs + tool-calling demos  
- Power-scaling patches: +30–40% efficiency margins  
- xAI application submitted: AI Tutor - Software Engineer Specialist role

## Quickstart
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/SeanSestinaEcoForge/SeanSestinaEcoForge.git](https://github.com/SeanSestinaEcoForge/SeanSestinaEcoForge.git)
cd SeanSestinaEcoForge
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook simulations/aquaponics-vermiponics-enhanced-ph-alk.ipynb
## Early Simulation Results (Chaos Data Flywheel)
First baseline run from `simulations/aquaponics-vermiponics-enhanced-ph-alk.ipynb` (default params: T=22°C, initial Alk=150 mg/L):
- **DO crash** to ~1.0 mg/L within days (hypoxic stress, below critical 4 mg/L)
- Alk decline to ~110 mg/L over 120 days
- Approx pH drop to ~6.8
- Likely fish mortality and ammonia buildup in this config
- JSON trace: [chaos-examples/baseline-default.json](chaos-examples/baseline-default.json)

Next steps: Tune for stable DO >5 mg/L, positive fish/plants growth, add stress variants (pH crash, overload, Mars low-PAR).
