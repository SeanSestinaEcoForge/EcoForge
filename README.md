# EcoForge

**Open-source, Grok-powered closed-loop homesteads**  
Earth abundance today, Mars bases tomorrow.  

$9–12k 20ft container prototype • 95%+ recycle • perchlorate-hardened bio-consortia • Optimus mounts • Starship-fit scaling.

Grok as nervous system → real-time monitoring, predictive what-ifs, adaptive coaching.  
Fork → simulate → build → iterate → swarm.

## Key Docs Live

These documents form the core of the v1.1 Master Protocol — setup, protocols, history, and scaling.

- **[Complete v1.1 Master Protocol Index](docs/master_protocol_index.md)** – full index & code seeds  
- **[Biochar Production](docs/biochar.md)** – retort & charging protocol  
- **[Master Thread Timeline](docs/master_thread_timeline.md)** – how we built this  
- **[Scaling Pathways](docs/scaling.md)** – horizontal to swarm  
- **backup/**: Full snapshot ZIP (timestamped) for safe versioning

More to come: CAD files, full BOM, expanded simulations, Grok prompt library.
